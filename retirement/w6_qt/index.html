                    <ul>
                        <li>Does heaven exist?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Quran: “gardens of pleasure,” there are rivers of wine. (Yes)</li>
                            <li>Anglican Bishop Stephen Lowe: I don't know. (Maybe)</li>
                            <li>Stephen Hawking: There is no heaven; it's a fairy story. (No)</li>
                            <li>Ancient Greeks: Yes, it's called Elysium. Achilles was in heaven but he told Odysseus who was visiting him it's boring there. (Yes, but not what you think)<br>
                                (Achilles' words from "The Odyssey": By god, I’d rather slave on earth for another man . . .than rule down here over
                                all the breathless dead.)</li>
                            <li>Bart Ehrman, a bible scholar, on "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross: People today, when they read the phrase kingdom of God, they think he (Jesus) is talking about heaven,
                                the place that your soul goes to when you die. But Jesus isn't talking about heaven because he doesn't believe - he's a Jew
                                - he doesn't believe in the separation of soul and body. (Really?)<br>
                                <!-- Some statistics: In The US, 85% of Christians believe in heaven while only 40% among Jews.

                            <a class="ted-link" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice">(TED Talk)</a>
                        </li>
                        Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice.
                        In Schwartz's estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.

                        our untapped love for all new possibilities, new experiences, new connections.

                        Perspective is everything, especially when it comes to examining your beliefs. Are you a soldier,
                        prone to defending your viewpoint at all costs -- or a scout, spurred by curiosity?
                        <br>
                        So, be a scout if you care about the truth. Be a soldier if you want to be popular.

                        </li>
                        In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society;
                        it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have.
                        (Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) In a talk and audience discussion,
                        Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?

                        Cameron Russell admits she won "a genetic lottery": she's tall, pretty and an underwear model. But don't judge her by her looks.
                        In this fearless talk, she takes a wry look at the industry that had her looking highly seductive at barely 16 years old.

                        Psychologist Jonathan Haidt studies the five moral values that form the basis of our political choices, whether we're left,
                        right or center. In this eye-opening talk, he pinpoints the moral values that liberals and conservatives tend to honor most.
